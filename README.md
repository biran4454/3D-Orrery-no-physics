# 3D-Orrery-no-physics
A 3D orrery built on Processing 3 using the PeasyCam library. Done without physical calculations, so will not be very accurate.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
### 1. Setting up
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Launch Processing and navigate to `Sketch > Import Library > Add Library`.
3. Scroll down until you get to Peasycam.
4. Click install.
5. Close the window to return to processing.
### 2. Launching the project
6. Open any of the `*.pde` files.
7. In Processing, there should be an arrow in a circle like this: (>).
8. Click it to launch the project.
### 3. Using the project
Left-click: rotate around object
Right-click / mouse wheel / up + down keys: zoom

0: focus on Sun
1: focus on Mercury
2: focus on Venus
3: focus on Earth
4: focus on Moon
5: focus on Mars
6: focus on Jupiter

'O': turn orbit trails on / off
'L': turn lables on / off
'Q': decrease time speed
'E': increase time speed
(space key): pause / unpause the simulation

### 4. Customise with user-set variables!
This is only recommended if you want to customise the simulation a little bit.
It doesn't require any coding skills.
Variables are in `Planets_v11_3.pde`
##### If you do know coding:
The user-set variables are just below the first multiline comment.
They are fairly well documented.
Feel free to create a pull request if you want to add one, or edit the comments.
